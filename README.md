This repository contains part of the formalization of [Bogdanov's lemma](https://mathoverflow.net/a/267013).

This work was done as part of my bachelor thesis "[Formal Verification of Mathematics Behind Quantum Optics Experiments](https://mpl.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Krenn_RG/bachelor_lode_vermeulen.pdf)", done under supervision of [Mario Krenn](https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/) at the [Max Planck institute for the science of light](https://mpl.mpg.de/) ([Artificial Scientist Lab](https://mpl.mpg.de/research-at-mpl/independent-research-groups/krenn-research-group/)).

A lot of credit goes to Pjotr Buys for formalizing the majority of the main statement in `bogdanov_step.lean`, being that the union of two disjoint perfect matchings in a graph that contains only disjoint perfect matchings forms a Hamiltonian cycle.
